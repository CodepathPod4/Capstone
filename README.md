Submitted by:

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

## Summary

"Moodify" is an Android app programmed in Kotlin where users can generate a list of songs based on their mood according to different tags from an API called last.fm. Different options for moods include "party," "sad," workout," "chill," and "study." The app utilizes a recycler view which enables users to scroll down for more songs in the generated playlist. This app is perfect for users who want to create a playlist according to their mood, but they do not have the time to do it manually.
